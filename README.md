#  Customer Churn Analysis
##  Project Summary
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom dataset to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Through detailed visualizations and statistical insights, the analysis highlights how demographics, service usage, tenure, contract type, internet availability, and payment methods affect churn. The findings reveal that senior citizens, short-tenure customers, and those without essential services are more likely to leave. Based on these insights, the project suggests targeted strategies to improve customer engagement and reduce churn.

The dataset includes customer information such as:
- Demographic details (age, gender, etc.)
- Service-related data (internet service, tech support, streaming services)
- Payment methods and contract types
- Churn information indicating whether the customer left the service

##  Key Insights
